# JSONLoops

JSONLoops is a multi-user audio sequencer reminiscent of Fruityloops. Audio playback is handled by node.js servers, while multiple browsers act as control devices. Songs are stored in the JSONloop format, which are simply nested JSON arrays.

# Disclaimer

This is Alpha software which was created for NYC Music Hack Day 2011. We won best collaborative project. This library works and is awesome. It could be epic if we all work on it.

## Installation

      npm install JSONloops
   
Now you will have to rebuild node as 32bit, since irrKlang doesn't support 64 arch's yet.

      cd /path/to/node
      ./configure --dest-cpu=ia32
      make
      make install

We'll be replacing this last step with a much easier process soon.

## Usage

To get started, you'll want to clone the JSONloops project and use the demo server

    git clone https://github.com/Marak/JSONloops.git
    cd jsonloops
    node server.js
  
The audio sequencer will now start playing on your local machine, you'll hear sounds. To access a control interface for your JSONloops server, visit http://localhost:8080/


## Why did you build this?

Because I'm insane.


## The JSONLoop format

A JSONLoop is nothing but a nested JSON array that follows a somewhat specific format.

    the arrays are nested in the following hierarchy 
    
    * SONG
    *   TRACKS
    *     MEASURES
    *       BEATS
  
Check out the [nyc.json](https://github.com/Marak/JSONloops/blob/master/loops/nyc.json) file or [metronome.json](https://github.com/Marak/JSONloops/blob/master/loops/metronome.json) file for example loops.

*can anyone create a proper json-schema to represent this? it also has to validate the loop is well formed...*
